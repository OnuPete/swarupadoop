************************************ASSEMBLY GENERATION CONSIDERATIONS************************************
There will be a generic header will prepend the assembly file:



All subsequent functions should be prepended with the following annotations




In the function's code block, space should be allocated for all local variables
    each local variable should be individually cleared with an xor operation

when returning variables from function calls, the return value should be placed in the $t9 register
All stack pushes should have an equal number of stack pops within the same scope, to prevent stack errors

Blocks within a function should end with either a JUMP, or RETURN instruction.
    this removes the need to order blocks properly for fallthroughs

No constants should be stored in the data section.  Because constants are statically known, 
	they should be defined in a macro
Each block should have a comment above it containing a description of its purpose
